# GitHub Pages Deployment Status

## 🎯 Issue: MIME Type Error Fixed

**Problem**: `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module but server responded with MIME type "video/mp2t"`

**Root Cause**: GitHub Pages was trying to load TypeScript files instead of compiled JavaScript.

**Solution Applied**:
✅ Enhanced build script with TypeScript compilation verification  
✅ Added error checking to prevent deployment of uncompliled code  
✅ Improved GitHub Actions workflow  
✅ Added debugging tools  

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

**GitHub Actions**: Will rebuild and deploy automatically  
**Expected URL**: https://pekkaro.github.io/rust-wasm-typescript-starter/  
**Build Verification**: Now includes checks for proper compilation  

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. **GitHub Actions Log**: Check for successful build completion
2. **Deployment**: Wait 2-3 minutes after push
3. **Browser Test**: Clear cache and reload the page
4. **Console Check**: Should see "Rust/WebAssembly module loaded! 🦀✨"

## 🛠️ Local Testing

```bash
# Test the exact build that goes to GitHub Pages
./build-for-pages.sh

# Debug what's being deployed
./debug-pages.sh

# Test locally with same configuration
./preview-pages.sh
```

## 📋 What's Fixed

- ✅ TypeScript properly compiles to JavaScript bundles
- ✅ No raw .ts files are deployed
- ✅ Proper MIME types for all assets
- ✅ WebAssembly files correctly bundled
- ✅ CSS and other assets properly processed
- ✅ Build verification prevents partial deployments

The next deployment should resolve all MIME type issues! 🎉
